# Admin Dashboard Issues - Progress Tracking

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Category Selection Issue in Add Product Form
- **Problem**: Categories were not loading in the product form dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect API URL in `loadCategories()` function (`/categories` instead of `/api/categories`) and missing authorization header
- **Fix Applied**: Updated `loadCategories()` function in `admin.js` to use correct API path and include authorization header
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. Missing Users Management Page
- **Problem**: "Users" link in admin dashboard led to non-existent `users.html` page
- **Root Cause**: `users.html` file was missing from static resources
- **Fix Applied**: Created `users.html` page with user management functionality (add, edit, delete users)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. Missing Backend Endpoints for User Management
- **Problem**: AdminController was missing individual user CRUD endpoints
- **Root Cause**: Only `getAllUsers()` was available, missing `getUserById`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`
- **Fix Applied**: Added missing endpoints to AdminController and corresponding methods to UserService
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Testing Required

### Critical Path Testing
- [ ] Verify categories load correctly in product form dropdown
- [ ] Test adding new products with category selection
- [ ] Verify user management page loads and displays users
- [ ] Test adding new users through admin interface
- [ ] Test editing existing users
- [ ] Test deleting users
- [ ] Verify proper authorization (admin-only access)

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Test with invalid category IDs
- [ ] Test user creation with duplicate emails
- [ ] Test user updates without password changes
- [ ] Verify error handling for failed API calls
- [ ] Test browser console for any JavaScript errors
